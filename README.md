# Proxy_Server

Proxy server is an application that acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. It receives requests from clients, forwards them to the appropriate server, and returns the server's response back to the clients.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Proxy_Server.git
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the proxy server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Send HTTP requests through the proxy server. The proxy server will forward the requests to the appropriate server and return the responses back to your client application.
